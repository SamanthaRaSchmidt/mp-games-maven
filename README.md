A mini-project for Grinnell's CSC-207.

Authors:

* Sam Schmidt
* Jenifer Silva
* Samuel A. Rebelsky (Starter code)

Instructions:

*  Welcome to Minesweeper.

        Command-line arguments:

        * -w width - set up the width of the board
        * -h height - set up the height of the board

        Your game board is a grid containing randomly placed mines
        hidden from your eyes. Mines are represented by 100's.

        Your goal is to click through as many safe spaces as you can.

        Each turn you will enter the row and column number you wish to reveal.
        Our row and column start at 0.
        You can only enter numbers 0 to max row / max column number.

        After each move, the surrounding blocks will reveal the number of mines near them.
        If you click a mine, you die.
        GAME OVER
